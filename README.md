# TASK-BIT-react

😆 Jokes On You! - A task given by Baltic Institute of Technology. Hosted fully on solar power 🌞, so if You can't connect to it - it means our precious sun didn't shine enough during the day ⛅. (or maybe I should attach more powerful solar panels 🐱)

# What does this project do?

This project fetches a .JSON file from [this website](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Programming?amount=10) and displays it in a vintage themed terminal.

# 100% Solar Powered

I'm hosting this project on a small single board computer which is using Linux and is connected to internet through WIFI. Solar panel is connected to a homemade powerbank which supplies this SBC with power.
